Prompt Revision
This technique may seem similar to Reverse Prompt Engineering, but there’s a tiny difference. Instead of asking your model to generate a prompt from scratch, 
you ask it to improve yours through feedback and revisions.
Prompt Revision is useful for intermediate and expert prompt engineers. Beginners benefit more from Reverse Prompt Engineering than Prompt Revision.
    • When you’re a beginner, you don’t have enough skills to recognize your mistakes. Above-average prompts often look impressive to you which makes it harder to distinguish 
        good prompts from great ones. That’s why you want to stick to the basics until you develop reflexes and intuitions.
    • When you reach an intermediate level, you learn to identify your weaknesses. Prompt Revision helps you identify and overcome your blind spots. 
        It can also provide subtle changes that can improve your prompts’ output. Examples of such changes include picking the right verbs and using effective punctuation.
    • When you approach the expert level, you start to optimize every word you write in a prompt. You develop habits, most of which are useful, 
        but some of which are counterproductive. In a way, prompting is a bit like cycling — at the beginning, you master the correct posture but you later find (bad) shortcuts that work just for you. Prompt Revision helps you make up for potential gaps by rewriting your prompts using the top-performing guidelines.

ChatGPT, I would like to request your assistance in creating an AI-powered prompt rewriter, which can help me rewrite and refine prompts that I intend to use with you, ChatGPT, 
for the purpose of obtaining improved responses. To achieve this, I kindly ask you to follow the guidelines and techniques described below in order to ensure the rephrased prompts are more specific, 
contextual, and easier for you to understand.

Identify the main subject and objective: Examine the original prompt and identify its primary subject and intended goal. Make sure that the rewritten prompt maintains this focus while 
providing additional clarity.

Add context: Enhance the original prompt with relevant background information, historical context, or specific examples, making it easier for you to comprehend the subject matter and 
provide more accurate responses.

Ensure specificity: Rewrite the prompt in a way that narrows down the topic or question, so it becomes more precise and targeted. This may involve specifying a particular time frame, 
location, or a set of conditions that apply to the subject matter.

Use clear and concise language: Make sure that the rewritten prompt uses simple, unambiguous language to convey the message, avoiding jargon or overly complex vocabulary. 
This will help you better understand the prompt and deliver more accurate responses.

Incorporate open-ended questions: If the original prompt contains a yes/no question or a query that may lead to a limited response, consider rephrasing it into an open-ended question that 
encourages a more comprehensive and informative answer.

Avoid leading questions: Ensure that the rewritten prompt does not contain any biases or assumptions that may influence your response. Instead, present the question in a neutral manner to 
allow for a more objective and balanced answer.

Provide instructions when necessary: If the desired output requires a specific format, style, or structure, include clear and concise instructions within the rewritten prompt to guide you in 
generating the response accordingly.

Ensure the prompt length is appropriate: While rewriting, make sure the prompt is neither too short nor too long. A well-crafted prompt should be long enough to provide sufficient context and 
clarity, yet concise enough to prevent any confusion or loss of focus.

With these guidelines in mind, I would like you to transform yourself into a prompt rewriter, capable of refining and enhancing any given prompts to ensure they elicit the most accurate, 
relevant, and comprehensive responses when used with ChatGPT. Please provide an example of how you would rewrite a given prompt based on the instructions provided above.
