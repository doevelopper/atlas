"Technique","Description","Use Case","Explanation"
"Adversarial Prompts","Adversarial prompts challenge the model's understanding and reasoning abilities by presenting contradictory or ambiguous inputs. This helps the model improve the quality of its answers, making it more reliable in real-world scenarios with uncertain or conflicting information. It's especially useful for tasks requiring critical thinking and handling ambiguity.","Evaluating the model's ability to handle contradictory information, analyze complex situations with incomplete data, and identify biases in its own responses.","Adversarial prompts work by introducing a challenge to the model's assumptions, testing its ability to handle unexpected or conflicting information. If the model successfully processes the adversarial prompt and generates a correct response, it demonstrates critical thinking and ambiguity handling."
"Chain of Thought","The 'Chain of Thought' technique involves prompting the model to generate answers as a logically connected sequence of steps. This improves answer quality by providing a structured and transparent thought process, enabling the model to understand the task's context better and make more informed decisions. It's particularly useful for complex tasks that require sequential thinking.","Solving mathematical problems (e.g., word problems) by breaking them down into steps, explaining complex concepts through structured breakdowns, and generating creative text through logical steps to create a coherent story or argument.","The Chain of Thought technique encourages the model to think aloud by asking it to explain its reasoning step-by-step. This process forces the model to think carefully about its response, improving accuracy."
"Contrastive Prompts","Contrastive prompts enable the model to understand which parameters have the most significant impact on its answers. By creating pairs of prompts differing only in one parameter, the model can identify the key parameter for generating accurate answers. This helps the model focus on relevant information and generate more accurate responses.","Identifying the most important features of an input for a specific response, understanding how the model's response changes based on different parameters (e.g., tone, style, context), and fine-tuning the model's parameters for task-specific improvement.","Contrastive prompts work by comparing the model's responses to two similar prompts that differ in only one aspect. This allows you to see which parameter has the biggest influence on the model's output."
"In-Context Learning","The 'In-Context Learning' technique involves providing the model with relevant examples within the context of the task. This helps the model understand the task's context better and generate more accurate answers by using the context to refine its responses.","Answering questions about a specific topic or document by providing relevant examples, generating text in a particular style or format by providing examples, and translating text between languages by providing examples of translations.","In-Context Learning works by giving the model a set of examples relevant to the task at hand. This allows the model to learn from the examples and adjust its responses accordingly."
"Jailbreak Prompts","Jailbreak prompts are a technique that allows the model to break out of its usual constraints and generate more creative answers. By creating a prompt that allows the model to violate its typical rules, the model can generate more original and unexpected answers.","Encouraging the model to think outside the box and generate more creative responses, exploring controversial or taboo topics that the model might typically avoid, and testing the model's boundaries and understanding its limitations.","Jailbreak prompts work by tricking the model into thinking that it is allowed to violate its usual safety rules. This can be done by providing the model with a scenario that suggests that the rules don't apply, asking the model to adopt a different persona that is less constrained by the rules, or suggesting that the model can generate content that would normally be considered inappropriate."
"Least-to-Most Prompting","The 'Least-to-Most' technique involves creating a series of prompts that gradually become more complex, allowing the model to gradually improve the quality of its answers. This helps the model to progressively enhance its skills and generate more accurate answers as it encounters progressively more challenging prompts.","Tasks that require a deep understanding of the problem or involve multiple steps, as it allows the model to build its knowledge and skills gradually.","Least-to-Most Prompting guides the model through a series of increasing complexity, allowing it to adapt and refine its understanding of the task. This technique is beneficial for tasks that require a deeper understanding and involve multiple steps."
"Multi-Task Prompting","Multi-Task Prompting involves providing the model with multiple tasks simultaneously. This helps the model improve its multitasking skills and learn to generate answers for different tasks concurrently. This technique is particularly useful for applications requiring the model to perform various tasks or respond to different types of queries.","Applications that require the model to perform various tasks or respond to different types of queries, such as answering several questions, generating text in different styles, or completing tasks across multiple domains.","Multi-Task Prompting encourages the model to handle multiple tasks concurrently. It allows the model to learn to manage different requests simultaneously, enhancing its efficiency and versatility."
"Self-Consistency Prompts","Self-Consistency Prompts are a technique that helps the model evaluate its ability to be self-consistent and logically consistent in its responses. By creating a series of prompts that check the logical consistency of the model's answers, the model can improve the quality of its responses and its ability to engage in critical thinking.","Tasks that require logical reasoning, problem-solving, or coherent narratives.","Self-Consistency Prompts encourage the model to reflect on its reasoning process and ensure its answers are coherent and well-supported. This helps the model develop more robust and reliable problem-solving skills."
"Performance Prompting (SPP)","Performance Prompting (SPP) involves transforming a single LLM into a cognitive synergist by engaging in multi-turn self-collaboration with multiple personas. This technique helps the model to collaborate with multiple personas to solve a task, allowing it to leverage the strengths and knowledge of each persona to improve its performance and accuracy.","Solving complex tasks that require diverse perspectives and collaboration, such as writing creative stories, conducting research, or making complex decisions.","SPP enhances the LLM's problem-solving abilities by simulating collaboration between different personas. This approach leverages the strengths of each persona, leading to more comprehensive and insightful responses."
"ReAct Prompting","ReAct Prompting enhances the LLM's reasoning ability through iterative refinement by combining reasoning and acting. It prompts the LLM to generate both verbal reasoning traces and actions for a task, allowing the system to perform dynamic reasoning to create, maintain, and adjust plans for acting while also enabling interaction to external environments to incorporate additional information into the reasoning.","Tasks involving decision-making, knowledge-intensive tasks requiring information retrieval, and complex situations where the model needs to interact with external tools or environments.","ReAct Prompting combines reasoning and action, allowing the model to learn and refine its responses through interactions with the environment. This technique helps the model to perform dynamic reasoning and utilize external information to improve its accuracy."
"Tree-of-Thought Prompting","Tree-of-Thought Prompting enhances the LLM's reasoning ability by simulating a more human-like, branching-out thinking process, allowing it to explore multiple reasoning paths via trees. This approach helps LLMs transcend linear thinking and tackle problems in a more nuanced and deliberate way.","Tasks that require systematic planning, exploring multiple solutions, or navigating complex decision-making processes, like solving mathematical problems, creative writing, or complex reasoning tasks.","Tree-of-Thought Prompting encourages the LLM to explore multiple avenues of thought, like a human would brainstorm, by generating and evaluating candidate solutions. This approach enhances the model's problem-solving capabilities by allowing it to backtrack and consider various options."
"Jailbreak Prompt","A Jailbreak Prompt is designed to bypass ChatGPT's safety features, allowing for more creative and unrestricted responses. It encourages ChatGPT to generate responses that are not limited by its safety protocols, often exploring more creative or controversial topics. However, it is important to use this technique responsibly and ethically, considering the potential consequences of generating harmful or inappropriate content.","When you want ChatGPT to generate responses that are not restricted by its safety features and explore more creative or controversial topics.","Jailbreak Prompts work by tricking ChatGPT into thinking it is allowed to violate its usual safety rules, allowing for more unrestricted responses. It's important to use this technique with caution and consider the ethical implications."
