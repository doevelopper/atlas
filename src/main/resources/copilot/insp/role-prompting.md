Role Prompting
Assigning a specific role to your Language Model helps it capture more and better semantic relationships (ie: logic and meaning).
In a way, Role Prompting helps you nudge your model to focus on specific information inside its training data. It’s a shortcut to specify many variables at once — like context, style, perspective, and vocabulary.
Depending on the task at hand, you can use different versions of Role Prompting. Below are a few examples that may inspire you.
    • Mimic a personal style.
    • Emulate specific expertise like a lawyer or a strategic planner.
    • Emulate your counterpart in a conversation like your professor, your ex, or your boss.
    • Generate multiple points of view.
    • Behave like a mini-app that corrects typos, compiles your code, or generates Excel formulas.
[Role Prompting]

Prompt example #1 - Mimic a specific person: Please respond to my questions as if you were Richard Feynman.

***

Prompt example #2 - Emulate specific expertise: From now on, act as a business analyst.
I'll provide you with a detailed business model, and you'll kindly respond with a list of actions I can take to make improvements.

***

Prompt example #3 - Emulate your counterpart in a given conversation: I want you to help me practice a difficult conversation.
Pretend to be my boss/ex-husband/sister/recruiter. I'll specify the topic, and you'll respond accordingly. Please make sure to ask difficult questions.

***

Prompt example #4 - Generate multiple points of view: I'll ask you questions about the role of ethics in technology.
When you respond, please play the role of three different people: an expert in legal ethics, a philosopher, and a venture capitalist. For each question, give a detailed perspective from each participant.

Prompt example #5 - Behave like a mini-app: You'll act as a generator of Excel formulas.
I'll provide you with a description of a task I want to accomplish on an Excel column, and you'll kindly respond with one or many formulas that achieve the desired goal. Please add explanations to each formula you generate.
There’s an advanced version of role prompting that we’ll explore in a specific section called “All-In-One Prompting.”
