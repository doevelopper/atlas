[Specify the desired format]

***

Example #2: I'm a One Piece fan. Please help me write a script for an episode titled The Demon's Eye Finally Opens.

***

Example #3: Please summarize the following document in the form of a corporate memo.
Note: if you use a non-specialized Language Model to generate legal contracts, make sure you run them by legal experts.

Specify the length of the desired response
Length is a proxy for the level of detail you want in a response. Length is also a constraint you sometimes must consider when writing specific formats like tweets, SEO descriptions, and titles.
Here are three examples of how you can specify length in a prompt:
[Specify the length of the desired response]

Prompt example #3: Please write five titles about the lack of skin in the game in Pascal's wager.

Specify the style/tone
Each chatbot has a default style defined by its creators. For instance, ChatGPT sounds friendly and nuanced, but you can ask it to change its tone to fit your preferences and needs.
You can even ask your Language Model to mimic the tone of a fictional/real person. Usually, the result is an over-the-top parody of whoever ChatGPT tries to emulate.
Here are a few examples of styles you can pick from:
    • Generic styles: formal, informal, persuasive, conversational, sarcastic, dramatic, condescending, nuanced, biased, humorous, optimistic, pessimistic, etc.
    • Domain-specific styles: academic, legal, political, technical, medical, news, scientific, marketing, creative, instructional, etc.
    • Mimicking the style of a real person: Agatha Christie, Daniel Kahneman, J.K Rowling, James Baldwin, Hajime Isayama, etc.
Here’s how you can specify the style in a prompt:
[Specify the style/tone]

Prompt example #1: In the style of a philosophy dissertation, explain how the finite interval between 0 and 1 can encompass an infinite amount of real numbers.

***

Prompt example #2: In the style of a New York Times op-ed, write a 1000-word article about the importance of dialogue.

***

Prompt example #3: Write a mini-guide about the importance of pre-processing data in Machine Learning. Use the tone of Jessie Pinkman from Breaking Bad.


Specify the context (also called “Priming”)
For each question you write, your Large Language Model can generate thousands of different answers. When you provide context, you help your LLM narrow down the range of possible outcomes.
Say you want a non-boring meal plan for the upcoming week. Adding your diet restrictions and personal preferences makes it more likely to get relevant suggestions for every single meal.
There are multiple ways you can introduce context into your prompt. It’s like mentally preparing your Language Model for the task, hence the name “Priming.”
[Specify the context]

Example #1: I invited a Jewish/Muslim/Buddhist friend over for a week. Please provide a complete meal plan for 7 days and consider my friend's diet restrictions.

***

Example #2: I work as a developer in a tech startup and I helped build two apps that allow users to collaborate on shared documents. Kindly provide me with 10 ways I can highlight my achievements as a developer. Use a bullet-point format.

***

Example #3: I'm from India/Kenya/Egypt, and English is my third language. I have a C2 level on paper and I want to improve my pronunciation. Can you please suggest 5 ways I can enhance my spoken English? Be specific and concise.


Specify the target audience
Language Models are trained on billions of words taken from diverse sources, including Wikipedia, research papers, and Reddit. Each source has its own audience, and each audience consumes information differently.
When you specify the target audience, you tell your model to adapt the content, the examples, and the vocabulary.
Consider two potential audiences for a prompt about the benefits of exercise: general adult readers and medical professionals.
For the first audience, you want your Language Model to use relatable examples and simple explanations. In contrast, the second audience would expect you to evoke studies and use technical terminology.
Even if the topic remains the same, the desired output can be extremely different. That’s why you want to indicate the target audience in your prompts/
Here are what the prompts would look like for the “benefits of exercise” example:
[Specify the target audience]

Prompt that targets general adult readers: Please explain the benefits of regular exercise in a way that is easy to understand for the general public.

***

Prompt that targets medical professionals: Please write a scientific article that targets medical professionals. The article discusses the physiological and psychological benefits of regular exercise. Make sure the article responds to the expectations of an audience of medical professionals.
One common mistake people make when writing prompts is to consider “style” and “target audience” as the same parameter. In reality, the style determines how the text sounds and the target audience decides which words to use.
Below is another set of examples of how to introduce the target audience in a prompt:
[Specify the target audience]

Example #1: Explain to an audience of visual artists how Generative AI will impact their field of work.

***

Example #2: Write a tweet that promotes an article about AI-driven disinformation. The tweet targets people interested in technology, communication, and social media.

***

Example #3: Outline a fundraising campaign and kindly add actionable tips. The content will be sent to a group of non-profiters to help them improve their current methods.
